  ${question_id("intro_4")} Asking DOR for help?
subquestion: |
  You can always ask the Department of Revenue's Child Support Enforcement Division (DOR) for help if you do not feel up to filing by yourself.

  If you do not feel safe, I can help you fill out a form that asks the court to keep your address secret, but if you still feel it is not safe for you to file on your own, ask DOR for help.
