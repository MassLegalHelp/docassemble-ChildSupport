  1. File a complaint for modification as soon as you decide that you need to change the child support order.

    **For example:**

      In January, you learn that you need to lower the amount of child support you pay.
      
      Your existing order is for $100/week.
      
      You file a **Complaint to Modify on February 10**. You {serve} the complaint on the defendant on February 27, and the court orders the lower amount of $80/week. 
      
      **You still owe $100/week in child support payments for the weeks up to Feb 27.** Only for the week beginning Feb 27 and the weeks after, can you start paying $80/week.
